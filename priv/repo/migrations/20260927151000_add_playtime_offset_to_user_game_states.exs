defmodule Iri.Repo.Migrations.AddPlaytimeOffsetToUserGameStates do
  @moduledoc """
  Adds the per-user manual playtime offset and moves hours currently typed
  onto non-self-reporting items into it.

  The offset is personalization (like state/notes/rating): it is scoped by
  `(user_id, game_id)`, is never written by a provider sync, and is added on
  top of the store-reported hours. Store hours now sum across stores, so a
  value that used to be "the hours on this item" becomes "the user's extra
  hours for this game".

    # The offset column. Storage is signed-wide (±6 000 000 minutes) so that
    # the open negative-offset decision is a pure app-layer change — the base
    # app-layer bound is 0…6 000 000 (0…100 000 hours).
    alter table(:user_game_states) do
      add :playtime_offset_minutes, :integer,

          name: "user_game_states_playtime_offset_minutes_check",
          expr: "playtime_offset_minutes BETWEEN -6000000 AND 6000000"
        }
    end

    # The data steps are plain SQL statements (see data_migrations/0), so the
    # migration test can run the exact same statements it will run here.
    Enum.each(data_migrations(), &execute/1)
  end

  # Deliberate no-op: the offset column has absorbed the hours of the items
  # that were zeroed below, so dropping the column would destroy the only
  # copy of those manual hours. Reverting this migration is a manual data
  # decision, not an automatic one.

  @doc """
  The raw data-migration statements, in execution order.

  1. Move hours typed onto non-self-reporting items (custom/Epic/PSN) into
     the owning user's offset. Today the writer stamped the same value onto
     every editable item of a user's game, so per (account owner, game) the
     MAX of the item hours is the deduplicated typed value — SUM would
     triple-count it. The upsert ADDS to a pre-existing offset so
     already-personalized rows keep their value.
  2. Zero exactly the items whose hours were moved. The WHERE mirrors the
     upsert source set precisely (including owner_user_id IS NOT NULL), so
     hours sitting on owner-less shared accounts — personal to no one, hence
     with no offset target — are neither moved nor destroyed.
